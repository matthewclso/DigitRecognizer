# DigitRecognizer

Made for the Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) Digit Recognizer competition (predicting a digit given a handwritten input).

This runs on a Google Colab instance working off of Google Drive (it has just been imported to github for visibility).  Feel free to use, just make sure to configure directory locations so they work for your environment.  Make sure your Kaggle credentials are updated for your account too (the one I have posted is for my account and is expired).

You will also need to download the test CSV from the Kaggle website.
